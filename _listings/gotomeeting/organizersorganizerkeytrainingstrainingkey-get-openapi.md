      description: This call retrieves information on all scheduled trainings for
        a given organizer. The trainings are returned in the order in which they were
        created. Completed trainings are not included; ongoing trainings with past
        sessions are included along with the past sessions. If the organizer does
        not have any scheduled trainings, the response will be empty.

      summary: Create Training
      description: Schedules a training of one or more sessions. The call requires
        a training's name, at least one start and end time, and optionally may include
        additional sessions, a description, additional organizers (presenters), and
        registration settings. You can only add organizers to a training if you have
        a multi-user account. Once a training has been created with this method, you
        can accept registrations to the training. Registration is for the entire training
        - all sessions. (The GoToTraining admin site enables you to create trainings
        that allow participants to register for individual sessions as well as automatically
        create weekly or monthly events.) Registration settings controls whether you
        allow web registration for this training, and whether a confirmation email
        is sent to the registrant following registration. Disabling the confirmation
        email is an API-only setting. If the user registers through the GoToTraining
        website, a confirmation email is sent. If the user is manually approved by
        the training administrator through the GoToTraining web site, the confirmation
        email is sent. It is recommended that you disable web registration if you
        disable confirmation emails. The response contains a trainingKey for the scheduled
        training.
